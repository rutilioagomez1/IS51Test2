create a list to store 24 number (float)
capture user's input 24 times
each time we capture the users input, we append the number to the list
sort the list ascending, then splice the items starting at index
once we have all numbers inputed in the list, we sum them up and divide by 24
output a message to the user
The program displays the number of grades
The average grade
The percentage of grades that are above the avergae grade
